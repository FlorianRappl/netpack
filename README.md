# netpack

🍭 netpack is an experiment to see if .NET written tooling can perform on an equal level to tools written in Rust or Go.

Right now netpack is not production ready and the likelihood that it works for your project is low.

If you like the idea and want to see this become a real thing then either support the project via code contributions or by [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/FlorianRappl) 🍻.

## Performance

![Bundler performance comparison](./docs/comparison.png)

The whole project is mostly geared towards performance. The key idea is that .NET with AoT (Ahead-of-Time compilation, i.e., no runtime dependency) can be on the same level as Go or Rust. While it still contains a GC (garbage collector, i.e., automatic memory management), the startup time is much improved. There is no JIT that is required to be run, which instantly yields good performance.

| Test                | esbuild     | rspack      | Vite        | **netpack** |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Small lib           | 326ms       | 611ms       | 601ms       | 359ms       |
| Small project       | 670ms       | 912ms       | 1658ms      | 418ms       |
| Medium project      | 1931ms      | 2877ms      | 10601ms     | 974ms       |
| Large project       | 2189ms      | 2422ms      | 13710ms     | 1357ms      |

Besides performance there are other reasons for choosing C#/.NET. It's arguably more readable than Rust, more powerful than Go, and better performing than JavaScript. The ecosystem, however, is lacking.

Another reason for having *another* bundler (but in .NET) is that it could be used *natively* within the .NET ecosystem, e.g., the post-process or optimize ASP.NET Core and / or Blazor web applications.

## Installation

Right now `netpack` is highly experimental and definitely **not** production ready.

You can add `netpack` to your Node.js project via your favorite package manager, e.g.:

```sh
npm i netpack --save-dev
```

Now you can run netpack like:

```sh
npx netpack bundle src/index.html
```

Generally, any *index.html* as for Vite or Parcel should work fine as an entry point. You don't need to supply an HTML file. You can also provide a JavaScript file directly:

```sh
npx netpack bundle src/main.mjs
```

You can start the dev server with the `serve` command:

```sh
npx netpack serve src/index.html
```

Right now this watches the file system - but it does not incrementally build nor does it hot-reload. Instead, it will just rebuild everything and reload the browser.

## Overview

The following items are features or topics that are relevant for bundlers - netpack in particular.

### General Features

- [x] Handle JavaScript
- [x] Handle JSX (right now only `React.createElement`)
- [ ] Handle TypeScript
- [x] Handle images (optimizes them using SkiaSharp)
- [x] Handle any asset
- [x] Handle CSS
- [ ] Handle CSS modules
- [ ] Handle SASS
- [x] Handle HTML
- [x] Handle JSON
- [ ] Handle codegen

### Bundler Basics

- [ ] Sourcemaps
- [x] Minification
- [x] DevServer with reload
- [x] Bundle analyzer
- [ ] Image / asset variants (e.g., width/height optimized)
- [x] Copy public assets
- [x] Externals (`--external react react-dom`; works also automatically if an importmap is present)
- [ ] True HMR (not just refresh)

### More Advanced Topics

- [x] Importmap support
- [x] Shared dependencies (`--external react react-dom`; automatically adds an importmap if HTML is used)
- [ ] Module Federation support
- [ ] Native Federation support
- [ ] React Fast Refresh support
- [ ] Platforms (web, npm)
- [ ] Tree shaking
- [ ] Other formats (esm, cjs, systemjs, umd)

## Idea Stash

Integration ideas / explorations:

- [Evaluate SASS from its official lib](https://github.com/Taritsyn/LibSassHost)
- [Port Acornima to support streaming + TypeScript](https://github.com/adams85/acornima/)
- [Integrate Codegen natively via Node.js](https://github.com/FlorianRappl/codegen-js/)
